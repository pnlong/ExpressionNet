# PDMX: A Large-Scale *P*ublic *D*omain *M*usic*X*ML Dataset for Symbolic Music Processing

Recent [copyright infringement lawsuits against leading music generation companies](https://www.riaa.com/record-companies-bring-landmark-cases-for-responsible-ai-againstsuno-and-udio-in-boston-and-new-york-federal-courts-respectively) have sent shockwaves through the AI-Music community, highlighting the need for copyright-free training data. Meanwhile, the most prevalent format for symbolic music processing MIDI, while suitable for modeling sequences of notes, omits an abundance of extra musical information present in sheet music, which the MusicXML format addresses. To mitigate these gaps, we present a large-scale open-source dataset of over 250K public domain MusicXML scores. We also introduce `MusicRender`, an extension of the Python library [MusPy](https://hermandong.com/muspy/doc/muspy.html)'s universal `Music` object, designed specifically to handle MusicXML.
